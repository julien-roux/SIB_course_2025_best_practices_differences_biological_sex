# Best Practices for Investigating Gene Expression Differences by Biological Sex

A course organized on Oct 27th, 2025 by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The course description and schedule can be found [here](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20251027_BIOSE).

Sex and gender have been historically ignored as explanatory variables in transcriptomics studies, in particular because of the fear that additional study variables might escalate experimental costs and complicate data analysis. However recent policies from funding agencies and scientific journals require attention to sex and gender in research projects. More and more biologists now incorporate biological sex as an experimental variable, but how to do so appropriately can still be challenging.

In this one-day course we aim at guiding biologists and bioinformaticians through the steps of designing robust experiments, with a focus on high-throughput transcriptomics experiments, and rigorously analysing them to draw statistically valid conclusions from such costly experiments.

## Repository content description

- `presentations/`: slides shown during the day, in particular the presentations from the organizers as introduction and [Frédéric Schütz from the University of Lausanne/SIB](https://www.sib.swiss/frederic-schutz-group).

- `hands-on/`: This folder gathers the hands-on material, notably the `.qmd` scripts used to guide the hands-on session. The dataset from this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-019-00090-2) was reanalyzed during the hands-on, starting from data reprocessed by the [recount3 project](https://rna.recount.bio/).

- `papers/`: PDFs of a few relevant papers.
